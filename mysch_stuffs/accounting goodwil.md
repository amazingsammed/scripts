# GoodWill
 
**Goodwill** is the benefit and advantage of the good name, reputation and connection of a business. It is the attractive force which brings in customers


**Goodwill** is defined as “the difference between the cost to purchase the business as a whole and the aggregate of the fair market value of its separable net assets”

### Goodwill has the following characteristics
1. It is an intangible asset.
2. It is incapable of realization separately from the business as a whole. That is, you cannot sell goodwill as a separate asset without selling the business.
3. Its value has no predictable relationship to any cost incurred.
4. The value of goodwill may fluctuate widely according to internal and external 
circumstances over a relatively short period.
5. The assessment of goodwill is very subjective.

### Reasons for valuation of Goodwill on the admission of a new partner
1. When a new partner is admitted he or she is entitled to a share of future profits (or losses) of the firm. 
2. Partners who join the firm later will receive part of goodwill when the business is sold as a going concern. 
3. Goodwill may exist but not reflected in the books in line with accounting theory. This implies that the existing partner’s capital will be understated. This is because the value of goodwill is credited to partners’ capital accounts. Therefore, valuing goodwill and crediting partners’ capital accounts accordingly on admission of a new partner(s) should reflect the true position of partner’s capital accounts.

### Where Goodwill Accounts is not to be maintained in the Books
Three methods are normally used to deal with goodwill. The methods include:
1. Memorandum revaluation method
2. Purchase and Sale method
3. Premium method

### Goodwill on Admission of a New Partner
1. The partnership deed spells out the terms under which a new partner will be admitted.
2. In the absence of a partnership deed, the admission of a new partner(s) is governed by the partnership Act 152. Among other things, the Act states that no person may be introduced as a partner without his/her consent and the consent of all existing partners.
3. When a new partner(s) is introduced into the partnership, he or she is entitled to a share of future profits (or losses) of the firm. 
4. New partners contribute to the firm certain sum of money in terms of capital. This is credited to his/her capital account.
5. In addition to this, in certain situations, the partner will normally be asked to pay some amount in respect of goodwill, and this is regarded as a **premium.** The premium is his contribution to the goodwill built up by the existing partners before his/her admission.
6. Whenever a new partner is admitted, goodwill is valued and, shared among the 
existing partners.
