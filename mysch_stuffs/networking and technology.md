# Networking

Networking is the connection between two or more computers to exchange data and information.

Networking is the process whereby the connected systems are Sharing resources

### core element of computer network
* Computers
* other computing devices. eg printers
* transmission medium(cables,wireless and fiber optics)
* Networking Interface card
* Wiring connectors(hub ,switch, router)


### Importance of Computer Network
1. To allow communication among computers and devices
2. To share information and other resources
3. To provide central administration
4. For security and reliability

### Forms of Computer Network
* Classification by Scale
* Classification by Scope

#### Classification by Scale
this is classifying them based on the role the computer systems play on the network.
**basic forms**
>  **Client**: it sources data from another computer or server
>
>  **Server**: it is dedicated to manage the resources of a computer network
>
> **Peer-to-peer**: all systems share resources among each other with each serving as client and server


#### Classification by Scope
This is classifying them based on the area they cover .
**basic forms**
> Local Area Network
>
> Wide Area Network




## Network Topologies

Computer Network topology is the way the systems on the network are physically arranged and how they are configured to operate.

### Types of Computer Network topology
* **Bus Topology**:
 one main cable runs through the entire network with the computers and other computing devices attached to cable at various points.
* **Star Topology**:
 all systems are connected to a hub or a router
* **Mesh Topology**:
 all systems are connected to each other
* **Ring Topology**:
 all systems are connected in a circular form with each computer being dependent upon the one preceeding it.
 
 
 
## Network Media, Cabling and wireless networking

* **Cabling** is the forming of a computer network with a cable.
* **Wireless** is the forming of a computer network without a cable.
* **Cable** is the medium through which data or signals move from a source to a destination
* **Media** is what data is transmitted over in a computer network environment.
* **Bandwidth** refers to the amount of data that is transmitted over a network media in a specific period of time.
* **Guided Media** is when cable is used in a network
* **UnGuided Media** is when air medium is used in network.

#### Mediums of Computer Network
* **Copper** (twisted-pair and coaxial cables)
* **Glass** (fibre optic cables)
* **Air** (wireless)

#### Differences between wire and cable
A wire is defined as a single or one electrical conductor where cable is a group of conductors.

#### Twisted pair cables
it is made up of 8 magnetic wires.it is a category of guided media.
there are two types namely 
* Sheilded twisted pair
* Un-sheilded twisted pair


## Network Protocols
protocol is a set of rules and procedures or instructions that define how computers and other computing devices interact with each other,

### Types of protocols
Hardware Protocols
Software Protocols

### functions of the types of network protocols

They enable communication
They enhances security of the network
they may support network management

### organisations who have developed and publish some protocols
> IEEE - Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers 
>
> IETF - Internet Engineering Task Force
>
> ISO  - International Organization for Standardization

**Network protocols** are established procedures and rules that define how systems in a computer environment relate to each other in terms of communication,management and security.

protocols used in computer environment all falls under 3 main protocol type
1. Application protocol {OSI MODEL 5 ,6 ,7}
2. Transport protocol {OSI MODEL 4}
3. Network protocol {OSI MODEL 1, 2, 3}
