* Transformation Process(locational transformation,Storage transformation,Exchange transformation,physiological transformation,attitudinal transformation)
* Outputs(volume{this refers to the quantity} ,standards{this refers to the quality})
* FeedBack(ensures that the systerm produces the desired results)


### Similarites betweeen goods and services

## Production and operations Strategy

**Production and operations Strategy** involves decisions specifying how a business organisation will allocate resources in order to support the firms infrastructure, the design of operation process and production.

**Competitive priorities** is the characteristics that a firm production and operation system must possess to support the business strategy in order to meet the demands of the markets in which the firm wishes to compete.

### Basic Competitive priorities
* Quality  
(`providing high quality goods`)
* Cost  
(`ability to manage production cost`)
* Delivery  
(`how quickly goods and services are delivered to customers`)
* Flexibility  
(`ability to deploy and redeploy resources in response to changes in customer preferences`)
* Customer focus  
(`concerntrates on fulfiling customers needs`)
* Know-how  
(`decreasing product life cycle`)

### SBU's
Strategic business units

#### Micheal porter , 3 generic business strategy

(`competing mainly on pricing`)
* Differentiation

* Focus Strategies
(`2 above on a narrow segment`)

#### business competing on cost ensures the following

* Elimination of activities that do not add value
* Too much stock must be avoided
* Reduce wastage
* Use well trained staffs
* All machines and equipment works perfectly

### Production system

Production system is a framework of activities within which the creation of value can occur

### characteristics of production system

1. production is an organised activity
2. the system convert various input to useful output
3. there exist feedback
4. it does not operate in isolation from other organisation systems

### 2 basic types of production systems
1. Continuous Production
(`is operates non-stop`)
`types are mass and flow production`
2. Intermittent Production
(`start and stops at irregular intervals`)


### characteristics of Continuous production 
1. The flow of production is continuous
2. The products are Standardized
3. The products are produced of predetermined quality standards
4. The products are produced in anticipation of demand
5. Standardized routing sheets are prepared

### characteristics of Intermittent production 
1. The flow of production is not continuous
2. wide varieties of products are produced
3. General purpose machines are used
4. operation changes as per design
5. The volume of production is usually small

### Components of Production and operations design
1. System design
2. System Operations


**System design** involves the decisions that relate to system capacity, the geographic location of facilities, arrangement of department and many others.theses decisions usually requires long-term commitment

 **System Operations** involves the management of personnel ,inventory planning and control and quality assurances
