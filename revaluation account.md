### When Revaluation Becomes Necessary
* Whenever there is a change in profit and loss sharing ratio, which results from a change 
in partnership, there is the need to undertake revaluation of assets and liabilities.
* The following circumstances will result in a change in partnership and hence, a charge in the profit and loss sharing ratio.
1. Admission of new partners
2. Retirement or death of a partner
3. The need to show the true value of the business:
    * Assets purchased long time ago may be underestimated in the books at their book value, for instance land and buildings 
    * Other assets may be valued for less due to obsolescence, for instance computers.
